The 'SimpleParse2.pm' is modified version of SimpleParse.pm from
HTML::SimpleParse package version 0.12. The differences between it and 
original version is more robust handling of broken html, and more properties
it extracts about html being parsed (mostly to avoid reparsing its output
for extraction of attributes or exact names of closing html tags). Also support
for event of type 'aspblock' was added.
Also support for empty tags (like <br/>) and for namespaces for elements and
attributes.
